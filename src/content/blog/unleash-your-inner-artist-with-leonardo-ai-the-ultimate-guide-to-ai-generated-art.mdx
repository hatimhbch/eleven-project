When you input a text prompt, Leonardo.ai's AI model analyzes the words and translates them into a visual representation. It then uses a process called diffusion, starting with random noise and gradually refining it into a coherent image based on your prompt and chosen parameters.

**Creating Your Masterpiece: A Step-by-Step Guide**

1. **Craft Your Prompt:**  Think about what you want to create and describe it in detail using keywords and modifiers.  For example, instead of just "cat," try "a fluffy cat sitting on a windowsill, bathed in warm sunlight, hyperrealistic style."

2. **Choose Your Style:**  Explore Leonardo.ai's diverse library of art styles, ranging from photorealistic to abstract, anime, and everything in between. You can even reference specific artists or art movements to influence the style of your creation.

3. **Generate and Refine:**  Once you've input your prompt and chosen your style, hit generate! Leonardo.ai will present you with multiple variations.  You can then further refine your chosen image, adjusting details and experimenting with different settings until you achieve your desired result.
